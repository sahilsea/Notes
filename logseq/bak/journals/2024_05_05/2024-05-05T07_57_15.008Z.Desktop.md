	- Data Structure an [[DS Intro]] .
		- A **data structure** is a way of organising data so that it can be accessed efficiently.
		- **Abstract Data Type** - Data type defines only how a data structure should behave and what methods it should have , but not the details surrounding how those methods are implemented.
			- Ex - List, Queue, Map, Vehicle etc.
		- ### **Intro to [[Big-O]]**
			- **Time** to  finish exec and **Space** for computation.
			- Big-O notation gives the worst case for an algorithm in terms of Time and Space That one algorithm would need.

			- #### Big-O Properties -
				- O(n + c) = O(n)
				- O(cn) = O(n), c > 0
				- Big-O only cares about large inputs so we can remove constants they won't increase over time.
				- f(n) = 7log(n)^3 + 15n^2 + 9
					- O(f(n)) = O(n^3)
				- Here we got O(n^3) because it the dominant term.
